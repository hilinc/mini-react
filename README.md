# mini-react

Aiming to implement a mini-react framework, including Fiber, virtual DOM, JSX, component, lifecycle, diff algorithm, etc.
In each directory, the code is some of my implementations in the learning process, some of which I wrote myself, and some of which I referred to others' code, I will explain in the README.md in each directory.

  <!-- The type="module" attribute in HTML is used to indicate that the script file should be treated as an ECMAScript module (ES Module). This means that you can use ES Module features, such as import and export syntax, within the script file to organize and share JavaScript code. This modular approach offers numerous benefits, such as encapsulation, reusability, and ease of maintenance of the code.
    
  In the index.js file, we import the App component and the ReactDOM library using import statements. This indicates that index.js relies on these external modules, and the type="module" ensures that the browser processes these imports and exports according to the ES Module specifications. Such practice makes the project structure clearer, facilitating development and future maintenance. -->
